_Batteries included: No extra gamefiles needed._

**Additional Notes**

- In its current state, the game only runs smoothly on a Raspberry Pi 4 and onwards or on x86.
- Preferences are in `~/.headoverheels/preferences.xml`.
- Savegames are held in `~/.headoverheels/savegame/*`.

**Notes for the First Start of the Game**

Do set in RetroPie's runcommand menu the resolution to 640x480 for performance reasons.

**Execute Scriptmodule to Deploy Content**

`sudo ~/RetroPie-Setup/retropie_packages.sh hoh`
